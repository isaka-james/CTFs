## Additional Informations:
#### Hints
1. Not only SQL injection exist but also NoSQL injection exists.
2. Make sure you look at everything the server is sending back

#### Links:
1. source code link: https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_atlas/33/app.tar.gz
2. running website: http://atlas.picoctf.net:63191/

## Explain what we should do:
1. Open burp suite and activate the monitor mode ( This is the best option because we can easly intercept and look the headers that are sent and received by the browser from the server )
2. Open the link given of the website in monitor mode (under burpsuite)
3. Open the source codes to see any clues that can help us
4. Login with mongodb no sql injection (the hint)
5. Look for flag

### Step 1:
Open burp suite and activate the monitor mode so later we can intercept the header easly.. 

If you get stuck, see the official documentation on how to enable [monitor mode](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/intercepting-http-traffic)

### Step 2:
Don't forget to forward the request..
If you don't know how to forward the requests, I advice you to see the [monitor-mode documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/intercepting-http-traffic).. I won't talk about that here!

Our browser opened successfully, with the login form.

### Step 3:
Now let's go to the source codes:

After getting the source codes now look for anything that may be important to us,

After struggling looking for clues, we've found the seeder(which is used to populate data in the database) , upon looking you can see that(in the above screenshot) that we have found username *joshiriya355@mumbama.com* , 

but the password is hidden with the server variable *process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD* ( which is almost impossible for us to know )

### Step 4:
Now it's time to login with the *mongodb no sql injection*, as we have the username so far,

We will use this sql:
```json
{ "$ne": null }
```
If you want to know further about that look [here]()https://portswigger.net/web-security/nosql-injection

After that we can look to our burpsuite and and see the request:

Then we'll be successfully login to the site,

### Step 5:
Then when we look to the responses from the server(on the burp suite ) we can clearly see the base64 encrypted thing,

Upon Decrypting we can clearly see the flag: I used [base64decode.com](https://www.base64decode.org/)
![flag5](https://github.com/isaka-james/picoCTFs-Solutions/assets/76619967/6cfeee1a-56bc-40c6-a96c-9982f01d52f5)


Wow that was so easy, Now you like have 200 points, Congrats!!!



Now you got the flag!!,

## DISCLAIMER
I didn't put the flag public so I don't violate the picoCTF policy.
